## Description

In this project I have created Daily planner that displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner and presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down. It is also color-coded for each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed. It allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
